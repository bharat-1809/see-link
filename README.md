**See-a-Link**! Get the preview metadata like title, description, image, video, etc from a link or a link extracted from the given text.

See-Link looks through the [open-graph](http://ogp.me/), [twitter cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup) markup and other meta tags to get the preview information from the link. It visits a link in a headless browser and scrapes the required information.

Check out [this article](https://dev.to/veerreshr/seo-tags-meta-tags-that-you-need-for-previews-on-social-networks-343n) to know about meta tags, SEO and their need for generating link previews.

**NOTE**

- A different domain cannot be requested from your web app (browsers block cross-origin-requests). If you do not know how same-origin-policy works, here is a [great article](https://dev.to/lydiahallie/cs-visualized-cors-5b8h), therefore this library works on node (back-end environments) and certain mobile run-times (like react-native).

- This library fetches the website and parses its html using [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/), as if the user would visit the page. This means that some websites might redirect you to a sign-up page. You can try to change the user-agent property (by default it uses [Facebook's user agent](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/crawler/#:~:text=app%20or%20website.-,Crawler%20IPs%20and%20User%20Agents,-The%20Facebook%20crawler)) and the response you get then might be different, but there is nothing wrong with this library.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install see-link
```

## Usage

Its quite simple:

```javascript
const seeLink = require('see-link');

(async () => {
    const preview = await seeLink('https://www.bharatsharma.me');

    // You can directly pass a url as above or pass a chunk of text
    // and seeLink will extract the first link from it. Like this:

    const preview_text = await seeLink('This text will be parsed by seeLink https://www.bharatsharma.me');

    console.log(preview);
})();
```

The above code will result in the following output:

```bash
{
  title: 'Bharat Sharma',
  description: 'Personal website of Bharat Sharma',
  image: 'https://bharatsharma.me/assets/images/logo.png',
  domainName: 'bharatsharma.me'
}
```

## API

```javascript
function seeLink(url: string, options?: seeLink.Options): Promise<SeeLinkRes>
```

`seeLink` takes a `url` and `options` object (*optional*). The `url` string can be **any link or a text containing a link**. It rejects with an error if there was no URL in the text provided.

`seeLink` returns a promise that resolves to the preview metadata of the following type:

```javascript
SeeLinkRes {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  domainName: string;
  video?: string;
  themeColor?: string;
  favIcon?: string;
  type?: string;
}
```

## Options

Additionally you can pass an options object to the function to change the default behaviour:

| Option Name | Function  | Type |
|-------------|-----------|------|
| detailedPreview | Get all the possible metadata supported by the see-link (eg: video, theme-color, type, favIcon) | boolean |
| getVideo | Get the video metadata along with the default result | boolean |
| getThemeColor | Get the theme-color metadata along with the default result | boolean |
| args | Arguments to pass to the puppeteer.launch function | string[] |
| userAgent | User-Agent to use when visiting the website | string |
| timeout | Timeout in milliseconds for the request | number |
| executablePath | Path to the chrome/chromium executable | string |
| headless | Whether to run the browser in headless mode | boolean |

## Test

The library is tested using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://chaijs.com/). You can run the tests by running the following command in the project root:

```bash
./test.sh
```

If `bash: ./test.sh: Permission denied` error is thrown, you can make the test executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x test.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run the tests by running the following commands in the project root:

```bash
npm run-script test-server
```

then in another terminal run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

*NOTE:* The test server runs on port `3000` by default. You can change the port number in `test_setup/config.js` file.
